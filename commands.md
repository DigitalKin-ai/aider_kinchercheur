# Recommended Command

Command: `npm install`
Explanation: The command `npm install` is used to install all the dependencies listed in the `package.json` file of the project. Since previous attempts to run `npm run build` resulted in errors indicating that `npm` is not recognized, it is likely that Node.js and npm are not properly installed or configured in the system. Running `npm install` will ensure that all necessary packages are installed, which may resolve the issues encountered when trying to build the project.
